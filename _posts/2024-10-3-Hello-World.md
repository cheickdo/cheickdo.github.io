When spinning up this blog site on a whim, I was mostly planning to leave little comments on technical projects I've been working on or current research/news but as this is the very first post, I feel it appropriate to start it off on a completely different note.

There exists **formal** and **ideological** approaches to studying literature. A **formal** approach would comprise *stylistics* or the structure of the text, whilst the **ideological** approach considers how language is used to transmit concepts to the reader.

Both approaches are used extensively when analyzing all forms of literature but their weightings would differ depending on the medium. A pertinent example would be in poetry where, unlike prose, form and structure is well defined and the piece is organized by verses, generally employing rhyming and/or syllabic rules. Likewise, In music we can also see these defined structures in the form of *phrases*, which allows for listeners to follow along and participate in the discourse. 

Scientific research also has rigid *stylistics* and conveys clear precise information. As any other form of literature there are great papers and there is fluff, but even Newton's *Principia* would fail as a poem. What I'm trying to say is that I hope that this can become a space where I can nurture my writing style by catering to a more humane audience and hopefully someone can suffer the side effect of learning something new.
